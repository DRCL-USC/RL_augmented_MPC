Description: # Learning
        Cleaned up learning codebase for quadruped robot learning
        
        ## Installation
        
        Then, install usc_learning as a package:
        
        `python3 setup.py install --user `
        or 
        `pip3 install -e . `
        
        
        ## Code structure
        
        - [learning](./usc_learning/learning) training and testing scripts
        - [envs](./usc_learning/envs) robot class and task environment for trainning
        - [tests] function tests for robot classes and task envrionments
        
        ## Status
        - PMTG locomotion task with IK
        - end-to-end locomotion task with Cartesian control
        - end-to-end locomotion task in joint space
        - MPC task to learn foothold offset from heuristic
        - manipulation task
        
        ## TODO
        - reimplement MPC
        - migrate jumping
